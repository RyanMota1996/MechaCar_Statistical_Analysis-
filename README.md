## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
From our linear regression we can see that the only two factors which reject our null hypothesis is Ground Clearance and Vehcile length, with their values being6.5 and 9.5 respectivly. Furthermore the p-value of the whole data set is 5.21e-08 which would entail that the slop is not 0, and tht new must reject our null hypothesis and say that there is indeed something here altering the MPG. Finally we can see from our R-Value we can say with 71% certainty that all the cars will follow this model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
when considering the requirmence that the variance of the suspension coil can not exceed 150 PSI we can see from both charts that we have obtained a varience of 62.29 PSI which is within our guidelines. However we see that when we look at our specific lots, that lot 3 sticks out as an outliner in this regaurd, with a varience of 170 PSI.
